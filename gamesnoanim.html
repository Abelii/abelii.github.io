            <p>You play as a blue ball in an infinite void, fighting to destroy the red balls.

                You have two weapons at your dispense, click <b>1</b> to switch to your pistol, which has a slow fire-rate but very good damage, click <b>2</b> to equip the assault rife, which as you can expect shoots a lot faster, but you move slower.
                
                <p>The current goal of the game is to kill as many enemies as you can, try not to die, and beat your high score. Enemies will sometimes drop ammo or health. Enemies come in different sizes, big chunky bois are slow but tanky, smol speedy bois are fast and die easily. 
                <p>This is just the first release and I'm planning on adding more weapons, upgrades, different types of enemies, power ups and much more.
                
                Thanks for playing and good luck!</p>
